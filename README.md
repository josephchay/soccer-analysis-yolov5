# Football Analysis

---

## Project Description
This project explores the analysis of football data using YOLO.

## Detection from Pre-trained YOLOv8x Model

The image shows a sample snapshot of detections from a pre-trained YOLOv8x model of a test football match video.

## Detection from Custom-trained YOLOv5 Model

The image shows a sample snapshot of detections from a custom-trained YOLOv5 model of a test football match video.
The dataset used can be found [here](https://universe.roboflow.com/roboflow-jvuqo/football-players-detection-3zvbc/dataset/1#).

## Detection Tracking
Each bounding box is tracked across frames using multiple factors such as object movement, appearance similarity.
